hockey
======

This codebase is the result of following [Lazy Foo's excellent guide](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) to SDL 2.0. Around July 2014 I started this Visual Studio project in hopes of someday turning it into some sort of hockey game.

It currently supports 4 players with basic collision with each other and icy/slippery physics. A frame counter and controller input information are overlayed at the top.
