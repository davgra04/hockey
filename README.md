hockey
======

This codebase is the result of following [Lazy Foo's excellent guide](http://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php) to SDL 2.0. Around July 2014 I started this Visual Studio project in hopes of someday turning it into some sort of hockey game.

For now it's a simple SDL instance that displays joystick input, a background sprite, and a controllable player sprite.
